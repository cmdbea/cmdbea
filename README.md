- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bea Archer! A transgender male to female programmer!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in JSON, FabricMC and coding custom Origins.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JSON.

A more in-depth look into me.

I like creating / coding custom origins for the famous Fabric mod 'Origins' by Apace100,  
I also use Visual Studio Code for most things I do. I usually use Twitter but I'm not active on it much.

**Games:**

Horizon Zero Dawn, Minecraft, Undertale and the Borderlands series.  

**Where to spot me?**

I usually lurk on the Official Origins Discord Server, I go as Bea on there.
